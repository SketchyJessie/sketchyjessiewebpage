<h1>Sketchy Jessie</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm a digital artist based in Kansas who's been drawing since a young age - practically my whole life. Inspired by the animations and comics I enjoyed as a kid, I started taking art seriously fairly young, and took on the craft, looking up tutorials, taking classes, and practicing regularly. Now, I'm a fairly experienced artist specializing in character and comic art.</p>
<p>Comics have been a huge part of my life - I used to love reading Naruto and dreamed of becoming a mangaka like Kishimoto. As early as middle school, I was making fun little comics in notebooks and printer paper with friends. In highschool, I started dabbling with webcomics and OCTs (Original Character Tournaments).</p>
<p>OCTs have been super important to my growth as an artist, teaching me a lot of skills related to project management, working in a deadline, working with people, getting things done, and just generally making comics - with the pressure and support of a community and external deadline. For someone with ADHD, who has always struggled to complete personal projects, this has been a big boon for me.</p>
<p>Thanks to the skills I developed in that environment, I've been able to work on an original webcomic: <a href="mournthestars.com">Mourn the Stars</a>. I've also done other webcomics that petered out, but I think OCTs specifically helped me develop a workflow that finally clicked. I've still run into issues and hiccups, but I'm working a lot more consistently than I have in the past.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm mainly working on personal projects - plus college - and can't accept any full-time work. However, I am accepting <a href="comms.html">commissions</a> at this time.</p>
